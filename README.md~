In order to create better, exciting micromice, it is necessary to pool together work in order to create better programs to run on micromice.

This repository basically has two folders: hardware and software.

Within the software folder will be folders with team names on them and will include libraries for turning and such in the parent folder.  The folders with team names will use symbolic links (supported in NTFS as well) to link to the files within the main folder.

Within the hardware folder, we will probably use KiCAD to plan out our PCB's.  KiCAD supports multiple-page schematics and large PCB's!

And through these methods, we will create better micromice.
