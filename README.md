In order to create better, exciting micromice, it is necessary to pool together work in order to create better programs to run on micromice.

This repository has folders for all current micromice.  Some may have been abandoned in favor of better mice (refmouse V1).

Although it is difficult to admit to the utter data-copying, a lot of the kicad libraries are copied.

Within the hardware realm, KiCAD is the de facto standard for making PCBs.  When micromice get really big, it's absolutely essential to choose a program that allows multipage schematics.

And through these methods, we will create better micromice.

Documentation is also provided through the documentation folder... in case anybody wants to read it.
