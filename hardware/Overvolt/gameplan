Our game plan in Micromouse (assuming that somebody else joins me) is to create a mouse with overvolted motors.

This involves complicated motor control in order to assure the functionality of our motors such as active, encoded braking; gyroscope (or compass) guided turns; and PD acceleration regulation.

This of course assumes that a lot of our control systems are working properly. (unfortunately, the PID funciton that I wrote sucks.)

The hardware will most likely consist of something complicated such as FPGA processing acceleration and expensive processors.
