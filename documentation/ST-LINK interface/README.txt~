How we do STLink
================

The STLink adapter interfaces to a boxed 2x10 header with 2.54mm (1 mil) pitch.  This interface is too large for our purposes.

So instead we have a 1.0mm device interfacing to these signals.

When the time comes, we will have a device interface on the IEEUCR website for all to use.
