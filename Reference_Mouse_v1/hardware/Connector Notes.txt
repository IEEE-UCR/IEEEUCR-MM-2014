It seems like every small DC connector attached to a battery gets called a "JST", which is not very helpful.

Lipo balance plugs are always "JST-XH"
	Easily recognized: 2.5mm pitch and "hooks" on the plug and recepticicle
	PCB-mount top-entry receptacle is B3B-XH-A (not B3B-XH-AM, that one has board-insertion orientation pin)
	Bal-plug pinout: http://goo.gl/ZAvH9i
		I'm going to call the top pin #1 so it stays GND

The protected 1S lipos and accessories sold by Sparkfun are NOT JST-XH (they are some other 2mm pitch JST)
	(Their 2S RC-style packs, however, do have JST-XH balance connectors)

The 2-pin red "JST" with beveled edges on the top?
	Those are actually "RCY connectors", manufactured by JST
	These are wire-to-wire only. There does not seem to be a PCB-mount version of these
